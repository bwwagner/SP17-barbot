Idea Guidelines:
* Swarm Robotics
* MUST be intelligent/dynamic robot
* Simplest deliverable

<h3>BarBot17</h3>
Bar bot will be a food delivery robot for a serving counter which can deliver small orders of drinks and appetizers to customers
who are sitting at the bar.  The robot will make cycles through the counter and ignore unoccupied spaces and filled orders on the route.
Its goal will be to deliver items as quickly as possible. We will simulate the environment of a bar with a narrow platform on which
we will place delivery areas and obstacles which represent the size and character of common objects which rest on a bar.
