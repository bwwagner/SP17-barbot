Idea Guidelines:
* Swarm Robotics
* MUST be intelligent/dynamic robot
* Simplest deliverable

<h3>BarBot17</h3>
Bar bot will be a food delivery robot for a serving counter which can deliver small orders of drinks and appetizers to customers
who are sitting at the bar.  The robot will make cycles through the counter and ignore unoccupied spaces and filled orders on the route.
Its goal will be to deliver items as quickly as possible by acting as a liason between the bar and a staging area where the drinks and appetizers are kept. We will simulate the environment of a bar with a narrow platform on which we will place delivery areas and obstacles which represent the size and character of common objects which rest on a bar.

Further options exist for extending the scale of the Bar Bot system. For instance, the functionality of the bot might be extended to include taking orders from customers. The system could be further extended to include another bot. In such a case, one bot might traverse a room, gathering orders from customers, and another bot would actually fulfill the orders.
