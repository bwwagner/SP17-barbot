This diagram outlines the wiring done for each component of the robot. The three core pieces of the system is the Arduino Mega ADK, Adafruit Motorshield, and Braccio Arm Shield. These three are stacked on top of each other with each lead of the Braccio slotting into the pins of the Adafruit Motorshield which then slot into the Arduino Mega ADK. This essentially makes the boards function as one unit, but this has been abstracted to be more clear. The Mega ADK has more analog and digital pins available in the front of the board. This allowed us to connect components to the board directly to improve the real estate taken up by the wiring, giving us more room for the arm to operate.
	Every component except for the Braccio arm in the Architecture is powered by the Arduino’s 5v source, and grounded by the Arduino’s GND. The arm is powered and grounded by the Braccio arm shield by use of the serial pins on the board. The Pololu Reflectance Array, and TCS3200 GBB Color Sensor input and output pins are all connected to the Arduino board. The Pololu LEDs are connected to the Arduino 5v. The TCS3200 GBB Color Sensor OE is grounded to the Arduino, and LEDs powered by the Arduino.
